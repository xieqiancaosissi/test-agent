# Bitte AI Agent NextJS Template

This template provides a starting point for creating AI agents using the Bitte Protocol with Next.js. It includes pre-configured endpoints and tools that demonstrate common agent functionalities.

## Features

- ü§ñ Pre-configured AI agent setup
- üõ†Ô∏è Built-in tools and endpoints:
  - Blockchain information retrieval
  - NEAR transaction generation
  - Reddit frontpage fetching
  - Twitter share intent generation
  - Coin flip functionality
- ‚ö° Next.js 14 with App Router
- üé® Tailwind CSS for styling
- üìù TypeScript support
- üîÑ Hot reload development environment

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure environment variables (create a `.env` or `.env.local` file)

```bash
# Get your API key from https://key.bitte.ai
BITTE_API_KEY='your-api-key'

ACCOUNT_ID='your-account.near'
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will:

- Start your Next.js application
- Launch make-agent
- Prompt you to sign a message in Bitte wallet to create an API key
- Launch your agent in the Bitte playground
- Allow you to freely edit and develop your code in the playground environment

5. Build the project locally:

```bash
pnpm run build:dev
```

This will build the project and not trigger `make-agent deploy`

- using just `build` will trigger make-agent deploy and not work unless you provide your deployed plugin url using the `-u` flag.

## Available Tools

The template includes several pre-built tools:

### 1. Blockchain Information

- Endpoint: `/api/tools/get-blockchains`
- Returns a randomized list of blockchain networks

### 2. NEAR Transaction Generator

- Endpoint: `/api/tools/create-near-transaction`
- Creates NEAR transaction payloads for token transfers

### 3. EVM Transaction Generator

- Endpoint: `/api/tools/create-evm-transaction`
- Creates EVM transaction payloads for native eth transfers

### 4. Twitter Share

- Endpoint: `/api/tools/twitter`
- Generates Twitter share intent URLs

### 5. Coin Flip

- Endpoint: `/api/tools/coinflip`
- Simple random coin flip generator

### 6. Get User

- Endpoint: `/api/tools/get-user`
- Returns the user's account ID

## AI Agent Configuration

The template includes a pre-configured AI agent manifest at `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json`. You can customize the agent's behavior by modifying the configuration in `/api/ai-plugins/route.ts`. This route generates and returns the manifest object.

## Deployment

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Deploy to Vercel or your preferred hosting platform
3. Add your `BITTE_API_KEY` to the environment variables
4. The `make-agent deploy` command will automatically run during build

## Making your own agent

Whether you want to add a tool to this boilerplate or make your own standalone agent tool, here's you'll need:

1. Make sure [`make-agent`](https://github.com/BitteProtocol/make-agent) is installed in your project:

```bash
pnpm install --D make-agent
```

2. Set up a manifest following the OpenAPI specification that describes your agent and its paths.
3. Have an api endpoint with the path `GET /api/ai-plugin` that returns your manifest

## Setting up the manifest

Follow the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-1) to add the following fields in the manifest object:

- `openapi`: The OpenAPI specification version that your manifest is following. Usually this is the latest version.
- `info`: Object containing information about the agent, namely its 'title', 'description' and 'version'.
- `servers`: Array of objects containing the urls for the deployed instances of the agent.
- `paths`: Object containing all your agent's paths and their operations.
- `"x-mb"`: Our custom field, containing the account id of the owner and an 'assistant' object with the agent's metadata, namely the tools it uses, and additional instructions to guide it.
